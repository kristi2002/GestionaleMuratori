# Post-v2 — "Cantiere" UI redesign rollout (in progress)

A ground-up visual redesign layered on the existing Bootstrap 5.3 stack (no build
step, CSP `'self'`, self-hosted assets): concrete-grey neutrals + hi-vis safety-amber
accent + blueprint steel, light + dark themes, persistent admin sidebar, self-hosted
Inter + inline SVG icon sprite. See the "Cantiere" entries in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

**Done & verified in-browser (light + dark):** app shell (anthracite topbar + brand
chip + theme toggle + role-aware admin sidebar), login, dashboard (KPI tiles + real
14-day trend sparklines), warehouse ledger detail, and all four Phase-4 legal screens
(Badge di Cantiere register, Giornale dei Lavori, S.A.L. list+detail, Scadenzario).

**Remaining — bring every page to the same bar** (semantic status pills, severity
stripes where relevant, tabular-mono figures/dates, dark-mode spot-check):
- [ ] Admin lists/details: clients, projects, **interventions (list + detail)**,
      warehouse (list), subcontractors, users, exports.
- [ ] Worker app: today/task tabs, intervention detail + **completion flow** + signature.
- [ ] Client portal: index, project show, reports.
- [ ] Subcontractor portal: index, project show.
- [ ] Cross-cutting: modals/forms, `errors/403|404|500`, and any remaining
      `card-header bg-white` / stock-blue Bootstrap components.
- [ ] Reminder: bump `public/sw.js` `VERSION` whenever these asset changes ship
      (cache-first shell serves stale CSS/JS otherwise).

Phases are ordered by risk: security first, then the features that make the
platform operable by the client, then infrastructure, then the proof (tests).
Each phase ends runnable and verified. Gap IDs reference
[GAP_ANALYSIS.md](GAP_ANALYSIS.md).

# v2 — Full-fledged Italian construction platform

Goal: a legally-compliant, offline-capable, **multi-site** platform for an *impresa
edile* in the Marche region — Badge di Cantiere, Giornale dei Lavori, S.A.L.,
Scadenzario Sicurezza, per-site inventory, subcontractor portal, PWA, accountant
export, deployed via **Coolify on Hetzner**. Domain background in
[DOMAIN_IT.md](DOMAIN_IT.md).

**Reservation model (decision):** *additive, site-optional*. Interventions keep
reserving from the main warehouse (location 1) by default, so `qty_in_stock` and every
v1 invariant/test stay valid; per-site balances + transfers are added underneath, and
`InterventionService::create/complete` take an optional `locationId`. A future
"site-first" default (material must be transferred to the cantiere before an
intervention can consume it) is a one-line default change, deliberately deferred.

## Phase 0 — Documentation baseline ✅ (this PR)
Docs corrected to code truth; new [DOMAIN_IT.md](DOMAIN_IT.md); v2 scope captured here
and in [GAP_ANALYSIS.md](GAP_ANALYSIS.md).

## Phase 1 — v2 schema, models, seed ✅ (this PR)
Migrations `003`–`009` (stock locations + location-aware ledger + balances + unit_cost;
subcontractors + role; site attendance; daily logs + equipment; S.A.L.; compliance;
photo geo). New `StockLocationModel`, `StockBalanceModel`. Seed extended with the main
warehouse, per-project site locations, item unit costs, and a subcontractor.

## Phase 2 — Multi-site inventory ✅ (this PR)
Location-aware `recomputeStock` (+ `transfer_in/out`), `StockBalanceModel::recompute`,
`StockTransferService` (warehouse↔cantiere transfers, one locked transaction, negative
guard), auto site-location on project create, warehouse transfer UI + route. **Fixed**
the `complete()` phantom-release bug (release only for `is_reserved=1`). Test-gated:
`tests/cases/04_multisite_stock.php` + a transfer-race in `11_concurrency.php`
(202 assertions green).

## Phase 3 — Subcontractor role & portal ✅
Register `subcontractor` in `UserController::ROLES` + `Auth::homeFor()` (→ `/sub`);
admin subcontractor CRUD + project assignment; `Sub\*` controllers +
`SubcontractorProjectGuard` (assigned projects only, 404 on not-mine). No inventory/cost
exposure.

## Phase 4 — Legal compliance features ✅
4a Badge di Cantiere (attendance + geolocation) · 4b Giornale dei Lavori (daily log,
weather auto-fill via `WeatherService`/Open-Meteo, closed-day immutability) · 4c S.A.L.
generator (locked PDF via a `SalPdfBuilder`, draft→issued→signed) · 4d Scadenzario
Sicurezza (compliance CRUD + ≤30-day expiry dashboard widget).

## Phase 5 — Field UX: geo-photos + offline PWA ✅
Capture `photos.lat/lng/captured_at`; `manifest.json` + `sw.js` (cache-first shell);
generalise the `localStorage` photo queue into a generic offline queue covering daily
log + attendance writes.

## Phase 6 — Reporting & exports ✅
Accountant Excel export (`AccountantExportBuilder`: material cost × `unit_cost`, worker
hours from attendance); route the remaining hardcoded-Italian report labels through
`lang/it.php`.

## Phase 7 — Deployment (Coolify on Hetzner) ✅
Harden `docker-compose.coolify.yml` (persistent volumes, env/secrets, outbound HTTPS for
weather); new `DEPLOYMENT_COOLIFY.md`.

## Phase 8 — Full test & simulation pass ✅
Extend the suite across all new features; fix→retest until green; live-drive the flows.

# v1 phases (delivered 2026-07-02)

## Phase A — Repo hygiene & security hardening (S1–S7, S9, T2)

1. **A1 Repo cleanup (T2)** — `git rm` the ~40 accidental zero-byte root files.
2. **A2 CSRF protection (S1, S9)**
   - `Support\Csrf`: per-session token (`random_bytes`), constant-time check.
   - Token exposed as `<meta name="csrf-token">` in the layout; `app.js` sends
     `X-CSRF-Token` on every AJAX request (covers FormData uploads too).
   - Central enforcement in the front controller for **every POST** (login included —
     token is on the login page); 419-style 403 JSON/HTML on mismatch.
   - Navbar logout becomes a POST button; `GET /logout` removed.
3. **A3 Login rate limiting (S2, S10)** — migration `002_login_attempts.sql`;
   record failures per email+IP; block after 5 failures in 15 min (Italian message);
   clear on success. Doubles as an auth audit trail.
4. **A4 Session hardening (S3)** — `use_strict_mode`, `Secure` cookie flag driven by
   `SESSION_SECURE` env (default: auto from `APP_URL` scheme), idle timeout
   (default 8h, env-tunable) with regeneration.
5. **A5 Debug default off (S4)** — default `false` in `config.php` and front
   controller; `.env.example` documents `APP_DEBUG=true` for local dev only.
6. **A6 Security headers (S5)** — sent centrally: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
   `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`, conservative CSP
   (self + inline styles needed by Bootstrap components).
7. **A7 Self-hosted assets (S6)** — vendor Bootstrap 5.3 + jQuery 3.7 into
   `public/assets/vendor/`; drop CDN links (offline-friendly worker app, CSP `self`).
8. **A8 Password change (S7)** — `/password` page for any authenticated role;
   requires current password; min length 8.

**Acceptance**: POST without token → 403; 6th bad login blocked; cookie flags
visible; no external requests on any page; password change works for all roles.

## Phase B — Platform completion (F1–F5)

1. **B1 User management (F1)** — `/admin/users`: list (search, role filter),
   create (role, client link for `client` role, generated or set password),
   edit, activate/deactivate (self-deactivation blocked), password reset.
   Migration not needed (schema complete).
2. **B2 Admin intervention detail (F2)** — `GET /admin/interventions/{id}`:
   description, schedule, materials (planned vs used), full status history with
   actor+timestamp, photos by type, signature, completion notes. New admin photo
   + signature streaming routes.
3. **B3 Operations dashboard (F3, F5)** — real KPIs on `/admin`: active projects,
   today's interventions by status, open interventions, **low-stock list**
   (`qty_in_stock ≤ reorder_level`, active items), links into filtered lists.
   Low-stock badge also on the warehouse list.
4. **B4 Worker task tabs (F4)** — `/worker` tabs: *Oggi* (default), *Prossimi*
   (future or unscheduled open tasks), *Completati* (last 14 days).

**Acceptance**: admin can onboard a new worker + client login end-to-end without
touching the DB; admin sees photos/history; dashboard numbers match the DB;
worker can reach non-today tasks.

## Phase C — Deployment on Hetzner (D1–D5, D7)

1. **C1 Docker stack** — `deploy/`: `Dockerfile` (php:8.2-fpm + gd/pdo_mysql/zip
   + composer install), `docker-compose.yml` (nginx, app, mysql:8, volumes for DB
   data + `storage/uploads`), nginx vhost (front-controller rewrite, static assets,
   client_max_body_size, security headers, HTTPS-ready), PHP ini overrides
   (upload sizes per D7, opcache, error log to stderr).
2. **C2 Production env template** — `.env.production.example` (debug off, strong DB
   password, `SESSION_SECURE=true`).
3. **C3 Backups (D2)** — `scripts/backup.sh` (mysqldump + uploads tar, 14-day
   rotation) + documented cron and **restore procedure**.
4. **C4 DEPLOYMENT.md** — step-by-step Hetzner guide: server creation, SSH
   hardening, ufw, Docker install, DNS, Let's Encrypt (certbot or Caddy option),
   first deploy (`migrate` + admin user creation), update procedure, monitoring
   via `/health`.

**Acceptance**: `docker compose up` on a clean machine serves the app on :80
with migrations applied; backup script produces a restorable archive.

## Phase D — Test suite & full simulation (T1)

1. **D1 Test harness** — dependency-free runner `tests/run.php` against a dedicated
   `gestionale_muratori_test` DB (fresh migrate + seed per run).
2. **D2 Unit/integration tests** — ledger math (reserve/complete/cancel cycles,
   reconcile, overflow guard, negative-stock block), state machine (all legal +
   illegal transitions), completion gate, validation helpers, CSRF token logic,
   rate limiter.
3. **D3 HTTP end-to-end simulation** — boots `php -S`, then as real HTTP clients:
   login flows for all roles, CSRF rejection, RBAC matrix (worker A vs worker B's
   intervention, client 1 vs client 2's project, worker → admin URLs),
   full lifecycle create→start→photo upload→complete with stock verification,
   user management flow, report downloads (PDF/XLSX magic bytes), rate limiting.
4. **D4 Fix–retest loop** — any failure is fixed and the whole suite re-run until green.

**Acceptance**: one command runs everything green on a fresh database.

## Phase E — Final documentation pass

Update README, ARCHITECTURE, DATA_MODEL, API for everything added; write
TESTING.md and DEPLOYMENT.md finals; full CHANGELOG for review.

## Out of scope for v1 (now folded into v2 above)

PWA/service-worker offline mode, GPS check-in, labor hours, and the cost/export
module were v1 "out of scope" items — all are now planned in the v2 phases above.
Still genuinely out of scope: S3 storage, multi-tenancy, e-mail notifications
(needs an SMTP account).
